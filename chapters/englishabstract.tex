Imaging technology has been widely used in military, industrial, civil and many
other fields. However, image will be random motion-blurred because of relative motion
between the scene and the time-delay imaging system, aero-optical effect or other seasons, and imaging performance of the machine vision system will be affected. Image
restoration algorithm is an effective way to improve quality of image. However, iteration
is used, so the shortcomings of the most widely used blind restoration algorithms are large
amount of computation and time-consuming, and it is difficult to meet the fast restoration
requirements in many fields. Linear restoration algorithms have not been practical application because of the limitations of the existing image quality evaluation function or
method. Therefore, establishing a new image quality evaluation model and combined
with the linear restoration algorithm is an effective means of rapidly restoring random
motion-blurred image.
The subject of “a fast restoration method for random motion-blurred image based
on DOTF”aims to strictly derive random motion Dynamic Optical Transfer Function
(DOTF) model, and use it to accurately describe the degradation law of random motionblurred image, and then a restoration method which extract DOTF from the blurred image
and combine with the linear filter algorithm is proposed. Iterative operation can be avoided in this restoration method, and the degraded image can be restored rapidly. These
researches offer a technology scheme for rapidly restoring random motion-blurred image, and it is good for improving real-time imaging performance of time-delay imaging
system.
The main research contents include:

\begin{enumerate}
\item In order to solve the problem of the existing image quality evaluation function
or methods can’t be used for rapidly restoring random motion-blurred image, a new evaluation function was built. Firstly, we rigorously derived Random motion DOTF models
in the space domain and in the spatial frequency domain separately, and they are mutual
verified because the two DOTF models are exactly the same; secondly, Using our DOTF model, we rigorously derived previously known DOTF expressions for static, uniform
motion and high frequency harmonic vibration, and according to the displacement function of the motion image is no limits to any motion type, our DOTF model can be
developed for random motion was verified; at last, by strictly derivation, we found that
our DOTF model is the Fourier transform of the existing aero-optical point spread function, it is therefore concluded that our DOTF model can be also applied to describe the
degradation rules of aero-optical random motion-blurred image.

\item The existing blind restoration methods have the characteristics of large computation and long operation time, in order to solve these problems, a fast restoration method
for random motion-blurred image was proposed. Firstly, the spectrum model of degraded
image was strictly derived, secondly, based on the border added and background equivalent static properties of the guide part of the degraded image, a restoration method of
extracting DOTF from the guide part of the degraded image and combining with the linear filter algorithms was proposed; at last, our restoration method was simulated, the
correlation coefficient between the restored image and original image is 1 proves the effectiveness of our method.

\item The rules of error impacts of our methods effect quality of the restoration
image were analyzed. Restoration models were built for the background is not uniform,
the image sensor has dark current, and there is random noise during imaging separately,
and the restoration method was simulated for the different models. The simulation results
show that: for nonuniform background, quality of the restoration image will be degraded
with increasing of the contrast of the background; for constant dark current, quality of
the restoration image will be unchanged as long as the dark current subtracted from the
degraded image during the restoration process; for random noise, quality of the restoration
image will be declined with increasing of the noise intensity. These results suggest that in
order to get a high quality restoration image, a background with low contrast and low noise
intensity will be chosen, and the dark current need to be subtracted from the degraded
image during restoration.

 \item The fast restoration method and the related theories are verified by experiments. Firstly, according to the measurement DOTF curves are agree to the theoretical
 ones at the same motion parameters, and the changing law of the DOTF curves in the
 spatial frequency direction with the change of velocity is agree to the theoretical result,
 the effectiveness of our DOTF model were verified; Secondly, secondly, according to
 the correlation coefficient between the blurred image degraded by software and the real
 degraded one is 0.9979 and the correlation coefficient between the blurred image with a
 Synchronous motion background and the one without Synchronous motion background is
 0.9994, the border added and the background equivalent static properties were verified; at
 last, The blurred images were restored by our restoration method and the existing ones, for
 quality of the restoration image, the GMG and LS of the images restored by our method
 are 5.77 times more than those of the images restored by the existing methods, and for
 operation time, the cost was cut nearly 90% by our method, it is therefore concluded that
 the advantages of our restoration method are not only improving the restoration quality,
 but also increasing the operation speed nearly one order of magnitude
